## Introduction

The Library Management System is designed to manage book collections, allowing operations such as adding, removing, searching, checking out, and returning books.
## Classes Description

- **Book**: Represents a book with properties like title, author, genre, ISBN, and availability status.
- **Library**: Manages a collection of books. It supports adding and removing books, searching by various attributes, checking out, and returning books.
## Usage

To use the system, instantiate the Library class and then add Book instances to the library.
Use the addBook, removeBook, searchByTitle, searchByAuthor, searchByGenre, getAvailableBooks, checkoutABook, and returnABook methods to manage the library.

## Testing

The LibraryTest and BookTest class demonstrates how to write unit tests for the system using JUnit.
Test methods cover the functionality of adding, removing, searching, checking out, and returning books.
This overview should give you a basic structure to further expand your documentation, including more detailed explanations, usage examples, and any specific configurations or requirements for using and testing the library system.
